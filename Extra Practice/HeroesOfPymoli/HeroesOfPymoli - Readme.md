## Read Me - Code Method

#### Initial work

- Import Pandas

- Load the Dataset





#### Player Count

- Print the list of columns from the purchase dataframe
- Identify my datatypes on the columns to prepare for any datatype changes that may be needed for calculations
- Print the top 5 observations to get an idea of the columns within the dataframe
- Get a count of the unique players
- Take the count of the unique players and put it into a dataframe
- Display dataframe


#### Purchasing Analysis Total

-  Run functions to obtain number of unique items (Item ID), average price (mean) number of purchases (count) and total revenue (sum)
- Take the calculations above and put it into a dataframe
- Format and display the data within the dataframe


#### Gender Demographics

- Group the players by gender and count the unique players for each
- Percentage of players using gender count of unique players for each over the total unique players 
- Take the gender demographic calculations above and put it into a dataframe
- Format and display the data within the dataframe


#### Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

- Group the data by gender
- Run functions to obtain number of purchases (count), average purchase price (mean), total purchases (sum) for each
- Then get the average total purchase per person using average purchase price and gender player count calculated previously
- Take the gender purchase calculations above and put it into a dataframe
- Format and display the data within the dataframe


#### Age Demographic

- Use a copy of purchase data
- Create bins to segment data in age groups
- Add the age group bins to the dataframe
- Group the data by the age groups and count the unique players for each
- Percentage of players using age group count of unique players for each over the total unique players 
- Take the age demographics above and put it into a dataframe
- Format and display the data within the dataframe


#### Purchasing Analysis (Age)

- User age group the data
- Run functions to obtain number of purchases (count), average purchase price (mean), total purchases (sum) for each
- Then get the average total purchase per person using average purchase price and age group player count calculated previously
- Take the age group calculations above and put it into a dataframe 
- Format and display the data within the dataframe


#### Top Spender

-  Group the data by players
- Run functions to obtain number of purchases (count), average purchase price (mean), total purchases (sum) for each
- Take the player calculations above and put it into a dataframe
- Format and display the data within the dataframe for top spenders


#### Most Popular Items

- Group the data by items (Item ID and Item Name)
- Run functions to obtain number of purchases (count), average purchase price (mean), total purchases (sum) for each
- Take the item calculations above and put it into a dataframe
- Format and display the data within the dataframe for most popular items


#### Most Profitable Items

- Take the item calculations above and put it into another dataframe

- Format and display the data within the dataframe for most profitable items
