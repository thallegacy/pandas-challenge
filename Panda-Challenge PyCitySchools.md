# Panda Challenge

## PyCitySchools



#### Initial work

·     Import Pandas

·     Load the Datasets (Remember to Change These)

·     Read School and Student Data File and store into Pandas DataFrames

·     Combine the data into a single dataset. 

 

#### District Summary

·     Print the list of columns within newly combine dataframe

·     Print the list of columns from the school dataframe

·     Print the list of columns from the student dataframe

·     Print the top 5 observations to get an idea of the columns within newly combine dataframe

·     Identify my datatypes on the columns to prepare for any datatype changes that may be needed for calculations

·     Check my counts to see if there is any null values

·     Copy to another dataframe for shorter name

·     Count the unique number of schools and add it to array of total schools

·     Count the number of students and add it to array of total students

·     Sum the budget of the schools to get total budget and add it to array of total budget

·     Average the number of students math scores and add it to array of average math score

·     Average the number of students reading scores and add it to array of average reading score

·     For a math passing score of 70 or above get the number students and get the total count

·     Calculate the total % of students passing math

·     For a reading passing score of 70 or above get the number students and get the total count

·     Calculate the total % of students passing reading

·     For a reading and math passing score of 70 or above get the number students and get the total count

·     Calculate the total % of students passing overall

·     Create a District Summary Dataframe to house my district summary

·     Format the District Summary Dataframe

 

#### School Summary

·     Create groupby dataframe from the merge dataframe to use for the school summary based on grouping of school name

·     Capture school types from original school input dataframe

·     Set the index to school name

·     Use groupby dataframe to get the total students per school

·     Capture the original budgets outlined in the school input dataframe

·     Set the index to school name

·     Capture the budgets per student using the school budgets over the students counts

·     Use groupby dataframe to get the average math score per school

·     Use groupby dataframe to get the average math score per school

·     For a math passing score of 70 or above get the number students

·     Then create groupby dataframe to get the count per school 

·     Calculate the total % of students passing reading per school

·     For a reading passing score of 70 or above get the number students

·     Then create groupby dataframe to get the count per school

·     Calculate the total % of students passing reading per school

·     For a reading and math passing score of 70 or above get the number students

·     Then create groupby dataframe to get the count per school

·     Calculate the total % of students passing overall per school

·     Create a School Summary Dataframe to house my school summary

·     Format the School Summary Dataframe

 

#### Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

·     Sort top performing schools by % overall passing.

·     Display the top five performing schools

 

#### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

·     Sort bottom performing schools by % overall passing.

·     Display the bottom five performing schools

 

#### Math Scores by Grade

·     Capture all the 9th grade students

·     Then create groupby dateframe to get the average (mean) math grade per school 

·     Capture all the 10th grade students

·     Then create groupby dateframe to get the average (mean) math grade per school

·     Capture all the 11th grade students

·     Then create groupby dateframe to get the average (mean) math grade per school 

·     Capture all the 12th grade students

·     Then create groupby dateframe to get the average (mean) math grade per school 

·     Create Average Math Score by students grade dataframe

·     Format the Average Math Score by Grade Summary Dataframe

 

#### Reading Scores by Grade

·     Capture all the 9th grade students

·     Then create groupby dateframe to get the average (mean) reading grade per school 

·     Capture all the 10th grade students

·     Then create groupby dateframe to get the average (mean) reading grade per school

·     Capture all the 11th grade students

·     Then create groupby dateframe to get the average (mean) reading grade per school 

·     Capture all the 12th grade students

·     Then create groupby dateframe to get the average (mean) reading grade per school 

·     Create Average Reading Score by students grade dataframe

·     Format the Average Reading Score by Grade Summary Dataframe

 

#### Scores by School Spending

·     Use a copy of school summary

·     Min and Max for Bin Ranges

·     Convert my columns back to numbers to use for calculations

·     Create my Bin Ranges

·     Create my Bin Labels

·     Create Spending Ranges (Per Student) column 

·     Create a Spending Ranges groupby dataframe

·     Capture values to put in summary of spending ranges per student dataframe

·     Create Spending Range per students Summary dataframe

·     Format Spending Range per students Summary Dataframe

 

#### Scores by School Size

·     Use a copy of school summary

·     Add school size column to dataframe
